Project Description
--------------------

The project utilizes real-time data collected by two types of sensors at 47 points in Nairobi, approximately every one second. The data underwent cleaning and was averaged on a daily basis. Subsequently, it was clustered based on temperature and humidity using k-means. The 47 points were then classified into six regions. Two specific regions were selected, and models were created to predict the temperature, humidity, PM2.5, and PM10 for each of these chosen regions.
